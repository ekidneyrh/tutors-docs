# Developer Experience (DX)

> The ***Developer Experience*** prioritises the specification and implementation of **robust**, **well documented**, **loosely coupled components & services**, integrated into a **coherent toolkit** open to contributions from **diverse skill sets**.

**Robust**: Unit & acceptance tests should a key part of each component

**Well Documented**: Each component should be adequately documented, sufficient to enable quality improvements and other enhancements

**Loosely Coupled Components**: The project should, as far as possible, consist of a set of reusable components, assembled into a range of applications and services. These components should strive to be independent , testable and shareable.

**Loosely Coupled Services**: Shares services like authentication, data store, presence, analytics should be shared across the tutors components and potentially decoupled, removed, or substituted as appropriate.

**Coherent Toolkit**: The role of each Component/Service should be clear and potentially substitutable by alternatives fulfilling equivalent roles. 

**Diverse Skill Sets**: The project should be open to all skill levels, with a welcoming and supportive environment.

## Generators

These tools are used to harvest a tutors course folder, for instance this example course here:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter>

... and transform the contents into web experience. If using a system such as Netlify, the process is [documented here](https://reader.tutors.dev/#/lab/tutors-docs.netlify.app/topic-01-create/unit-1/book-a/Netlify). The generators can also be run from the command line:

~~~bash
npx tutors-json
~~~

~~~bash
npx tutors-html
~~~

These will generate, respectively:

- A JSON encapsulation of the course, suitable for publication on a CDN based edge distribution platform (Netlify, Vercel)

- A static site, browsable locally.

These are generated into the `public-site` and `json` folders inside the project folder.

### tutors-lib

This is the tutors course parser, packaged as a reusable component:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-lib>

This abstracts the course structure, constructing a traversable, recursive data structure comparable to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the course

### tutors-json

This is the JSON generator:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-json>

This will use `tutors-lib` to parse a course, traverse the generated AST and emit the JSON course.

### tutors-html

This site the HTML generator:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-html>

It will also use `tutors-lib` to generate a static site
