*Tutors: An Open Learning Web Toolkit*

The Tutors Open Source Project is a collection of open source components & services supporting the design, publication, consumption and monitoring of engaging, rich media, web based learning resources. The project supports three complimentary experiences:

- The ***Learner Experience*** prioritises the consumption of learning objects  that are **contextual**, **linkable**, **searchable**, **accessible** and **responsive**. In addition the experience should foster a sense of **community** and **connection** among fellow learners. 

- The ***Educator Experience*** prioritises the creation of learning objects that are **autonomous**, **structurally aligned**, **composable**,  **auditable**, **extensible**, **versioned** and **independent**.

- The ***Developer Experience*** is open to contributions from **diverse skill sets**, prioritises the implementation of **robust**, **well documented**, **loosely coupled** components & services.
