# Educator Experience (EX)

> The ***Educator Experience*** prioritises the creation of learning objects that are **autonomous**, **structurally aligned**, **composable**,  **auditable**, **extensible**, **versioned** and **independent**.

**Autonomous**: Learning resources should be capable of being self hosted, independent of any tutors cloud services.

**Structurally Aligned**: The structure of learning content should mirror the layout and sequencing of the desired learning experience.

**Composable**: It should straightforward to construct courses from elements of other courses and combine courses into programmes and other configurations.

**Auditable** It should be possible to ascertain whether students have engaged with specific learning resources.

**Extensible**: It should be possible to introduce new, parallel learning services within a family of tutors tools.

**Versioned**: It should be possible to place a course under git based version control, supporting rollback, branch previews and other version management conveniences.

**Independent**: It should be possible for an educator to migrate from the tutors  to other comparable systems within the static site generator category of tools.
